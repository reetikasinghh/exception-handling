Check Division and Eligibility
Aim
The aim of these programs is to demonstrate the use of exception handling and decision-making in C++.

Theory
These programs showcase two different aspects of C++ programming. The first program involves division and exception handling. It allows the user to input two numbers and checks if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero. The second program focuses on age-based eligibility, checking whether a person is eligible based on their age.

Algorithm - Program 1
Request the user to enter two numbers.
Capture the entered numbers.
Check if the second number is not equal to zero.
If it's not zero, perform the division and display the result.
If it's zero, throw an exception to handle division by zero.
Catch the exception and display an error message.

Algorithm - Program 2
Request the user to enter their age.
Capture the entered age.
Check if the age is greater than or equal to 18, which is often a common age criterion for eligibility.
If the condition is met, display an eligibility message.
If the condition is not met, throw an exception.
Catch the exception and display a "Not Eligible" message.


Conclusion
Both of these programs illustrate the use of try-catch blocks and decision-making in C++. The first program demonstrates how to handle exceptions, specifically division by zero. The second program highlights the use of age-based eligibility checks. These are fundamental programming concepts that can be expanded upon in more complex applications.
